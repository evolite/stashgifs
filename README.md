# StashGifs 🎬

Turn your Stash scene markers into an endless scroll of looping GIFs. It's like TikTok, but for your favorite moments.

## What's This All About?

Ever wish you could just scroll through your scene markers like you're doom-scrolling social media? Well, now you can! StashGifs transforms your markers into a vertical feed of auto-playing videos that loop endlessly. Just keep scrolling and let the algorithm (okay, it's random) serve you the good stuff.

## Getting Started

Install it via Stash's plugin system using the `index.yml` file. That's it. You're ready to scroll.

## The Good Stuff ✨

Scroll through your markers like a social feed. Videos auto-play as you browse (HD videos wait for you to hover). Click performer or tag chips to filter on the fly. Every load gives you a fresh random mix. Heart your favorites, track o-counts, rate with stars, or jump into full HD mode with audio. Feeling adventurous? Use the random scene player to discover new content and add markers on the spot. Works great on mobile too!

## How to Use It

**The Feed:**
- Click any performer or tag chip to filter instantly
- Search bar opens a full-screen dropdown with trending tags and saved filters
- Search is smart—type "finger" and it'll find "fingers", "finger - pov", etc.

**On Each Card:**
- ❤️ Heart it to favorite (adds a tag in Stash)
- 💦 Increment the o-count
- ⭐ Rate it (0-10 stars)
- **HD** Switch to full scene with audio
- 📌 Add a marker at the current timestamp (in random mode)
- **+** Add more tags
- ▶️ Open in Stash at the marker timestamp

**Video Controls:**
- Play/pause, seek, fullscreen—you know the drill

## For Developers 👨‍💻

```bash
npm install    # Get the dependencies
npm run build  # Build it
```
